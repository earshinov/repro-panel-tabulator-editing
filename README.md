1\. Install dependencies:

```
$ poetry install
```

If you are not using poetry, you might use `requirements.txt`. However, this is not recommended as the sources of truth are `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.

2\. Open the project in VS Code (if you haven't done so yet), open and run `repro.ipynb`.
